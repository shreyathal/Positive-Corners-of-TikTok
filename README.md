# Positive-Corners-of-TikTok
This project was developed by Shreya Thalvayapati and Vrnda Aiyaswamy at Northeastern University for JRNL 5500: Coding for Storytelling.
While scrolling through TikTok can often feel mentally draining and overstimulating, this project aims to spotlight the platform's more positive and uplifting corners. This projecty is built primarily using Svelte, with custom styling in HTML and CSS.
